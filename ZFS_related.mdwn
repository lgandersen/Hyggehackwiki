# ZFS related bits & pieces
All kinds of ZFS related stuff, e.g., frequently used commands, scripts, small guides and so on.

## Backing up jails with zfs send/receive and ssh
This is my general procedure for backing up jails on my hetzner box.
Goedel is the computer at home storing the backup and brouwer is my hetzner server.

First, I create a dataset containing the backup snapshots. Since this is only used for backup storage
I used the strongest compression possible which is gzip-9 AFAIK.

    $ sudo zfs create cryptpool/backup
    $ sudo zfs set compression=gzip-9 cryptpool/backup
    $ sudo zfs create cryptpool/backup/brouwer_jails

Since goedel is behind NAT I create a reverse tunnel when ssh'ing into brouwer from goedel

    $ ssh -R 8000:127.0.0.1:22 brouwer

Create snapshots of all jail (and ezjail-related) data sets on brouwer

    $ sudo zfs snapshot -r cryptpool/jails@backup_test
    $ zfs list -t snapshot | grep -v 'daily\|weekly\|monthly'
    NAME                                                            USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
    <snippet_start>
    cryptpool/jails@backup_test                                        0      -   504K  -
    cryptpool/jails/basejail@backup_test                               0      -   385M  -
    cryptpool/jails/newjail@backup_test                                0      -  3.81M  -
    cryptpool/jails/a.jail.on.brouwer@backup_test                      0      -  18.2M  -
    <snippet_end>

### To ways of sending snapshots
Now, with newer versions of FreeBSD (=>10, I think) it is possible to send/receive recursively as well.
Thus, to be able to send/receive the /cryptpool/jails data set and all descendeing data sets, just use

    $ sudo zfs send -R cryptpool/jails@backup_test | ssh localhost -p 8000 sudo zfs recv -euv cryptpool/backup/brouwer_jails

This is quite easy and straightforward. However, this have several disadvantages from my point of view. The main ones are

1. All snapshots are sent from cryptpool/jails and descending datasets.
Since I have a lot of snapshots from zfs-periodic that I do not want to transfer this is a bit annoying.
2. All properties of the original data sets is copied with the zfs send stream.
This includes compression and mountpoint, both of which I do not want.
The former is because I use stronger compression on the backup machine than the source and the latter causes all backup datasets to be mounted on /usr/jails/ on the backup machine (together with my jails there!).
3. My backup machine is on a slow internet connection so it would be nice to send it one jail at a time, such that if a connection timeout occurs I can restart from the last jail I was sending.

Therefore I have made this small script that outputs another small script that sends each jail data set seperately. It also avoids omits the ezjail datasets basejail and newjail.
